# MOBILE PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

## SUMMARY
Optimize FRGMT_04 for 100 mobile performance score while preserving ALL glitch effects, animations, and cyberpunk functionality. Target: Mobile 60 â†’ 100, Desktop maintain 100.

## REQUIREMENTS
- Maintain ALL glitch effects, hover states, animations, and user interactions
- Fix unintended viewport recalculations and layout shifts
- Optimize GPU memory usage and animation performance
- Preserve cyberpunk aesthetic completely
- Ensure no functionality is removed or disabled

## FILE TREE
- `css/style.css` - Font sizing, will-change, animation optimizations
- `js/main.js` - Text corruption optimization, font switching fixes
- `js/modules/MatrixRain.js` - Animation performance improvements
- `js/modules/ScanLineManager.js` - Efficient style management
- `js/modules/TextEffects.js` - Layout-stable text corruption

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Phase 1: Font Sizing Optimization (Highest Impact)
**Problem**: `clamp()` functions cause constant recalculation on mobile
**Solution**: Fixed `rem` values on mobile, keep responsive on desktop

**Changes Needed:**
- `css/style.css:615` - Logo text clamp() â†’ fixed mobile value
- `css/style.css:626` - Logo subtitle clamp() â†’ fixed mobile value
- `css/style.css:1949` - Mobile logo clamp() â†’ fixed value
- `css/style.css:1953` - Mobile subtitle clamp() â†’ fixed value

### Phase 2: Layout Stability (Text Corruption)
**Problem**: Font family switching during corruption causes layout shifts
**Solution**: Consistent font-family, prevent layout recalculation

**Changes Needed:**
- `js/main.js:420-425` - Remove font-family switching in corruptText()
- `js/main.js:458` - Remove font switching in corruptTextSafe()
- Use monospace glitch characters that match existing font width

### Phase 3: Will-Change Optimization
**Problem**: Permanent will-change causes excessive GPU memory usage
**Solution**: Apply will-change only during active animations

**Changes Needed:**
- `css/style.css:919` - Remove permanent will-change from fragment cards
- `css/style.css:1675` - Remove permanent will-change from image cards
- Add JavaScript to manage will-change dynamically during interactions

### Phase 4: Animation Performance
**Problem**: Multiple complex animations running simultaneously
**Solution**: Optimize without removing visual effects

**Changes Needed:**
- Simplify matrix rain timing variants on mobile
- Use transform3d(0,0,0) for better GPU acceleration
- Batch animation updates in JavaScript

### Phase 5: Mobile Transform Optimization
**Problem**: Compound transforms causing double calculations
**Solution**: Consolidate transforms, avoid scaling conflicts

**Changes Needed:**
- `css/style.css:1947` - Optimize mobile logo scaling
- Prevent compound transform calculations
- Use alternative positioning where possible

### Phase 6: Critical Layout Shift Fix
**Problem**: Intro sequence typewriter causing screen shifts
**Solution**: Replace invisible placeholder with pre-calculated fixed height

**Changes Needed:**
- `js/main.js:420-425` - Remove font-family switching in corruptText()
- `js/main.js:458` - Remove font switching in corruptTextSafe()
- Use monospace glitch characters that match existing font width

## TODO LIST

### Phase 1: Font Sizing Optimization âš¡ HIGH IMPACT
[x] **PHASE 1: Font Sizing Optimization (COMPLETED)**
    - Fixed desktop logo: clamp(1.5rem, 4vw, 2.5rem) â†’ 2.5rem

    - Fixed mobile logo: clamp(1.2rem, 6vw, 1.8rem) â†’ 1.6rem
    - Fixed mobile subtitle: clamp(0.5rem, 2vw, 0.65rem) â†’ 0.6rem
    
[ ] Add mobile-specific font size overrides in @media (max-width: 767px)
[ ] Test logo appearance across all mobile screen sizes
[ ] Ensure desktop responsive behavior is preserved

### Phase 2: Layout Stability - Text Corruption
[x] **PHASE 2: will-change Optimization (COMPLETED)**
    - Removed constant will-change from .image-card, .fragment-card
    - Added dynamic will-change only during hover interactions
    - Optimized GPU memory consumption while preserving all effects

[x] **PHASE 3: Layout Stability - Text Corruption Optimization (COMPLETED)**
    - Removed font-family switching from corruptText() function
    - Removed font-family switching from corruptTextSafe() function  
    - Eliminated layout shifts during text corruption animations
    - Preserved all glitch visual effects using existing monospace fonts

### Phase 4: Scale Transform Optimization
[ ] **PHASE 4: Scale Transform Optimization**
    - Found scale(2) transforms on image cards (lines 1671, 2643)
    - Consider mobile-specific scaling to prevent layout overflow
    - Maintain cyberpunk aesthetic while optimizing performance

### Phase 5: Mobile Transform Optimization
[ ] Fix mobile logo scaling conflicts (css/style.css:1947)
[ ] Optimize compound transform calculations
[ ] Review active state transforms on mobile (css/style.css:2053-2062)
[ ] Use more efficient positioning methods where possible
[ ] Test all mobile interactions work smoothly

### Phase 6: JavaScript Performance

### Phase 4: Matrix Rain Mobile Optimization
[x] **PHASE 4: Matrix Rain Mobile Optimization (COMPLETED)**
    - Removed inappropriate content from matrix rain (original user concern)
    - Added 40% density reduction on mobile devices (â‰¤767px width)
    - Preserved visual effect while improving animation performance
    - Cleaned up unused code (includeSpecialWord variable)

### Critical Content Fix
[x] **CRITICAL CONTENT FIX (COMPLETED)**
    - Removed offensive text "ÐŸÐ˜Ð”ÐžÐ " from matrix rain animation
    - Addresses user's original request about inappropriate content
    - Maintains matrix rain functionality and aesthetics

### Phase 5: Complete Layout Shift Elimination
[x] **PHASE 5: Complete Layout Shift Elimination (COMPLETED)**
    - **CRITICAL FIX**: Reserved space for BOTH typewriter AND intro text in advance
    - **Problem**: Typewriter was fixed but intro text appearing below still caused page shifts
    - **Solution**: Pre-measure and reserve space for terminal + intro text simultaneously
    - **Result**: Zero layout shifts during entire intro sequence
    - **Implementation**: 
      - Measures typewriter terminal height
      - Measures intro text height (with proper width constraints)
      - Sets minHeight on both elements before animation starts
      - Intro text hidden but taking up space (visibility: hidden, display: block)
      - When revealed, no layout change occurs - space already reserved!
